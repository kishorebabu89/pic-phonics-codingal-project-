## **_Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend development_**
---
## **Project Description**
This project is a multi-sensory phonics game developed for children, designed to incorporate a visual, auditory, and interactive learning experience.
The idea was developed as an educational tool for both parents and teachers, to provide an interactive platform for learning phonics that is simple , easy to access, use and understand. It should help children to
develop their reading comprehension and understanding of the relationship between written letters and spoken words. This game will encourage decoding, reading and writing skills for children of all language abilities.
The game focuses on initial phonics sounds aimed at children between the ages of 3 to 6, with plans to expand it to include options for different levels. This will allow children the ability for progression within the learning platform.
This project combines technology with education, in line with the primary school curriculum in Ireland, to incorporate ICT through active learning. It should be fun and engaging, and provide a positive experience for users. Technology is a 
huge part of society today, and children encounter technology at a very young age. It is important to utilise this technology to encourage learning and understand that it can be used as a positive resource in
a child's development. It can be a powerful tool in developing life skills.

## **UX**

This website was designed as an interactive educational tool for both teachers and parents, to help children learn the initial phonics sounds. 
The look and feel is vibrant and inviting. The website is created as to be user-friendly, easy to navigate, and provide a multi-sensory learning experience
to cater for a variety of different learning styles.

### **_User Stories_**
- As a teacher, I would like to have access to an interactive learning platform that would allow me to incorporate ICT and active learning within the classroom. 

- As a teacher, there are not enough phonics resources freely available online that incorporate a multi-sensory approach to phonics.

- As a teacher, I would like to show children that learning can be fun and enjoyable.

- As a teacher, I would like to see more interactive learning that incorporates aspects to fit individual learning needs.

- As a parent, my child like to play games after school on my tablet and I would like if there were more games that included learning aspects to enhance my child's development.

- As a parent, in the middle of a pandemic, with all the schools closed, I would like to engage more with my child's learning experience but I do not have the correct knowledge of how some topics are meant to be taught.

- As a teacher, I would like to strengthen the consistency of school and home learning.

- As a parent, I would like to access learning activities for my child that are accessible on multiple device types.

### **_Strategy Plane_**
 - The aim of the project was to develop an interactive phonics game as an educational tool to help children learn knowledge of the letter sounds. It was designed to be user-friendly,
 easy to navigate. It was created with the purpose of teaching children the initial phonics sounds, and the words associated with these sounds. It was extremely important that it also
 adopted a multi-sensory, inclusive approach, so that it would be beneficial to the user, regardless of their learning style or abilities. For this reason, it was essential to include audio, 
 visual and written elements within the game, to help the user grasp a clear understanding of phonics and aid them in their learning process.

### **_Scope Plane_**
- The priority for this project was to ensure the game worked well, was easy to use and comprehend, and achieve the learning outcomes of the phonics curriculum. It was essential that all elements 
were executed to the best of my ability. Given my time frame and skills, I decided to focus on the first two units of the initial phonics sounds aimed at junior infant age range (4-6). 
This includes the letters: T, A, S, M, I, H, C, K, O, P, L, E, and G. The design would be a one page website, with an inviting and vibrant homepage with minimal text, a game section that would include 
questions(letters) and 4 choices for each question using images as the choices. These choices would include text underneath each picture, with the item in the image written in text. It would also include a results section where 
the user would be able to see the result they achieved on completion of the game. An additional feature I wanted to include was the option to obtain a certificate with their name and score at the end of the game, or
if they wish, they could restart the game with the intention of learning and improving with each attempt.
The idea of the certificate was as a reward element for users, an element they could print out if they wish. As the website is aimed at children, it was important to make sure it easy to
read, easy to navigate and the instructions were clear. These elements also needed to be easily accessible at any point in the game.
- When it comes to learning, it is crucial to create a platform that caters for all different learning abilities and styles. This is why it was essential that it was a multi-sensory
game, which includes auditory, visual, written and interactive elements. The choices were designed as images that could be clicked instead of inserting radio buttons, a button is included so 
users can hear the letter sound, as well as see the letter as it would be written (in both upper and lower cases). Underneath the images, the word that each picture represents in text format is included but hidden. This text is revealed once the
user has selected their answer choice, this is so the answer is not revealed to the user before a choice has been made.

### **_Structure Plane_**
- The structure of the website was designed to be inviting, vibrant and visually attractive to users. There is minimal text used and plenty of
vivid imagery, to capture the attention of the user. The homepage is bright and includes a simple and straightforward navigation bar. It
also contains a full view height background image, and a callout, that gives the user a brief introduction to the purpose of the website. Directly underneath this 
is a large call to action button. This has a glowing feature that draws the attention of the user and invites them to begin the game. The game itself is mainly structured using clear and vibrant images as well as 
brief text on what the user has to do. The images are clickable which encourages interactivity, and enhances visual interpretation skills. The audio elements 
provided at the click of a button. The has a clear description of it's purpose, and allows the user to hear how the letter sounds, when spoken.
- On completion of the game, a results page is displayed, which includes a simple form for the user to complete if they wish to generate a certificate. It has two
other buttons that allow the user to restart the game or exit the game if they wish. The instructions are always available on the navigation bar, which are viewable at
any stage of the game, and are displayed through a pop up scrollable modal.
The certificate is an extra addition which will allow the user to generate a certificate showing their name, and the score they received.

### **_Skeleton Plane_**
It is a one-page website, with a separate page for the certificate that is generated at the end of the game. It includes 3 different sections,
when each section is displayed, the other sections are hidden until they need to be accessed.
These sections are as follows:
- Homepage Section
- Game Section
- Results Section
- Certificate (if the user wishes to generate a certificate after the game is completed)

#### **_Wireframes mockups_**
- [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes_alldevices.pdf)
- The initial design for this site has always been the same, a simple but vibrant and inviting website. It incorporates lots of vivid imagery
, many calls to action, minimal text and easy access to game information at any time, for ease of use for the user.

### **_Surface Plane_**
#### **_Colours_**
- The colours chosen for this project were based on research of colours that best facilitate children's ability to learn.
Blue is described as universally the best colour to use in learning activities, as it can enhance reading comprehension. It is also 
a calming and relaxing colour. A lighter shade of blue was chosen as research also shows, lighter shades create a lighter and positive vibe. 
Blue drives productivity, it is ideal for highly cognitive and challenging tasks.
Yellow is a vibrant colour and is shown to grab and maintain children's attention while learning. It generates positive energy, and encourages creativity.
- Other colours I have chosen to use are red and green. Red stimulates energy, and green promotes a feeling of relaxation and ease.

#### **_Typography_**
- When choosing the typography for this project, I consulted with my sister who is a primary school teacher. She was able to give me advice on the best typography to use
in this project. It was important that the text was inviting and visually appealing, with an easy to read typeface. In light of this advice, I decided to use 'Fredoka One' 
for the headers and buttons and 'Sniglet' for the body text.

#### **_Images_**
- The images for this project were obtained from a couple of different resources. The letter images for each question in the game were sourced from [TeachersPayTeachers.com](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Large-Alphabet-Flash-Cards-Capital-Lowercase-1137338?st=1c42baaf6b98ba8c603c374104b2be5b)
- The images for the choice options in the game were obtained from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
- The background image for the containers was sourced from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) 

## **Features**
### **_Navigation Bar & Footer_**
- The **navigation bar** is in a fixed position, making it easy for users to access the navigation elements of the website, and allow them to view these elements at any point during or after the game.
- The navigation bar consists of a **logo** to the left, which acts as a link back to the homepage, and **three navigation links** to the right. These links are 'Instructions', 'Play', and 'Exit'. The 
instructions link when clicked opens up a **pop up scrollable modal**, which displays the step by step instructions of how the game is to be played. The play link allows the user to start the quiz 
and the exit link acts as means to exit the game at any point and return to the homepage. The 'Exit' link includes an **alert** when clicked, that asks the user if they are sure they want to exit the game, in 
case this link was pressed by accident they have the ability to cancel the exit request or confirm it. The navigation bar is **responsive** and the navigation menu collapses into a **hamburger menu** for both 
tablet and mobile devices. 
- The footer is fixed at the bottom and contains **copyright information** located in the center. 

### **_Homepage_**
![Homepage](screenshots/homepage.jpg "Homepage")

- The homepage consists of a full width height, **responsive image**. It is a bright but subtle background image with a **callout** which is the title of the website and a brief introduction to the purpose of the website.
- Directly under the callout there is a **large button** 'Let's Play', it is styled to have a **glowing effect**, to draw the attention of the user. When clicked, it takes the user to the game section where the game begins.

### **_Game Section_**
![Game Section](screenshots/game-section.jpg "Game Section")

- The game opens immediately when either the 'Let's Play' **button** or the 'Play' **link** on the navigation bar is clicked. The game section has the same **background image** as the homepage but with a blue container for the questions and answers.
- The game container includes a **score box** where the users score is tracked, a brief sentence stating which letter this question refers to, an **image** of the letter in both upper and lower cases and adjacent to this is a **yellow button** 'Click for Letter Sound'
is placed. This button, once clicked, allows the user to hear the sound of the letter using an **audio clip**. This functions as an **auditory** element to aid with linking the written letter with the spoken language.
- The choices section consists of, a brief statement alerting users to what they must do to select an answer. Then the user is presented with 4 **images**, these are the choices that they will select an answer from. The images are **responsive** and display as a 
**2 column display** on larger and medium screens, and **one column display** on smaller devices such as phones. These images have been programmed to be **clickable**. Once a user has selected an option, they will receive an alert which will be either a 'correct' **alert** 
or an 'incorrect' **alert**. Both alerts feature encouraging messages, so that regardless of the user's choice, the user will not be discouraged from continuing.  This is a learning process so it is essential to make the user feel at ease and supported throughout the game.
- After the answer has been selected, the corresponding words for each image will be revealed to the user for a few seconds. This gives the user a chance to see the words associated with each picture in writing. I chose to hide the **text** until an answer was selected, as
the written text will give the answer away and defeat the learning outcomes. 
- I have programmed a set **timeout** function to give the user time to view the text before the next question is displayed on the screen.
- When all questions have been answered and the game has come to a close, a **'Submit' button** appears at the end of the container that will give the user the ability to submit their choices to receive a total score in percentage format.

### **_Results Section_**
![Results Section](screenshots/submit-resultspage.jpg "Results Section")

- The results section is displayed once the 'Submit' button has been clicked. This consists of the same **background image** on the homepage with a title 'Results'
and directly underneath this, the user result is displayed. The **result** is shown as follows: "You have scored 70% in the Pic Phonics Initial Sounds Game".
- Below this is a **form container** coloured blue that includes **2 input values**: 'First Name' and 'Last Name', these inputs are required if the user decides they would like to generate a **certificate** of their results. This form is **validated** so the user will not be able to select the 'Get Certificate'
**button** if these input fields are empty or invalid.
- In order to generate a certificate of their results, I have included a 'Get Certificate' **button** below the **input fields**, which has been programmed to get the input values inserted and the user's score. These values are then displayed on a **separate HTML** document created in the form of a **certificate**.
- Another feature that is included in the results section are two **buttons** displayed at the end of the container named: **'Exit'** and **'Restart Game'**.
- The **'Exit' button** when clicked will trigger an **alert**, it will ask the user if they are sure they would like to leave the game. The alert contains a **cancel button** and a **confirm button**. If the user confirms they would like to leave the game, then they will be taken directly back to the **homepage**.
If the user selects the cancel option, the alert will close and the user will remain on the current page.
- The **'Restart Game' button** when clicked, will take the user back to the beginning of the game. It will display the **game container** and first question, this will also prompt the **score** to **reset**.

### **_Certificate_**
![Certificate](screenshots/certificate.jpg "Certificate")

- The certificate element of the game was designed to create a personalised certificate for each user. It is populated using the **input fields** in the result section, to identify and obtain the user's name. The **score** that the user receives in the game is 
also populated into the certificate HTML file. 
- The user can then save this certificate as a **PDF**, or can be **printed** directly from the browser, if the user wishes to do so.
- The certificate contains the **company name**, the **user name**, the **name of the game**, the **score** and the **company logo**.

## **Existing Features**

#### **_General_**
- The navigation bar is displayed as a **fixed top** element, and is located at the top of the page at all times for each section. 
- The navigation links are easily accessible, the **company logo** text provides a link to the homepage on the far left side of the **navigation bar**, and three **navigation links** to right hand side with links 'Instructions', 'Play' and 'Exit'.
- The instructions link opens a pop up **scrollable modal dialog box** containing the instruction for how to play the game, the play link takes the user to the beginning of the game. The exit link opens an **alert**, asking the user if they are sure they would like to leave 
and includes a **cancel** and **confirm** button in the alert. If the user clicks cancel it will close the alert and if the user clicks yes to confirm, it directs the user back to the **homepage**.
- The footer is fixed at the bottom of the screen and contains **copyright** information displayed in the center of the footer.

### **_Homepage_**
- The homepage is designed with a full width height **hero image** of letter blocks with an **opaque overlay**, a **callout** that provides a brief introduction to the user about the purpose of the game, and a **large glowing button** labelled 'Let's Play'. This glowing effect draws the attention of the user
and, once clicked starts the game. It directs the user to the **game section** and displays the first question.

### **_Game Section_**
- The game section is a designed as container that includes the following: a score container which is top and displays the **users score** throughout the game. Undernath this, there is a statement that declares which letter is being shown in the **image** directly below it. This image is located within 
a **three column display** with the first column empty, the second column containing the **letter image** in both upper and lower case and the third column holds the **audio button**, 'Click to hear letter sound'. This button when pressed allows the user to hear the **audio** of the letter sound.
- Underneath this is the question container, which is a brief description in text, telling the user what is required to answer the question.
- The answers container is displayed below this which contains 4 **images**. It is designed using **four columns**, one per image, each **50% width** of the game container. On larger screens it will be displayed showing 2 images side by side on top and 2 images side by side on the bottom, a **grid** of four images.
On smaller screens the images are displayed in a **one column block** formation one after the other. The answers were designed as **radio buttons** with the **image**, **input** and **span text** wrapped inside a **label tag**. Using CSS, the radio button element was hidden. This allows the image to act as a radio button,
when the image is **clicked**, the radio button element is also **checked**.
- When a user selects an answer by clicking an image, the span text is revealed, e.g Image is banana, text revealed reads 'BANANA'. A brief **timeout** has been set and then the next question is displayed automatically. If the user selects the **correct answer**, they will receive an **alert**, and also a score of 1 will be added to the **score box** at the top of the game container.
- If the user selects the **incorrect answer**, they will also receive an **alert**, however no score points will be added to the score container. Both alerts contain **positive feedback** messages encouraging the user to continue in the game.
- At the final question, after the user selects an answer, a **'Submit' button** is displayed at the end of the game container. When this **button** is clicked, it will take the user directly to the **results section** of the website.

### **_Results Section_**
- The results section has a background container that displays the same **background image** as the homepage, with a **section header** 'Result' displayed at the top of the page. Directly underneath this, there is a brief statement telling the user the overall result they scored, in **percentage format** from the game. This statement is displayed as follows: 'You have scored 70% in the
Pic Phonics Initial Sounds Game'
- Below this is a **form container** that has a **sub-heading** stating that the user can fill in their details if they wish to generate a certificate for their game results. This form has two **input fields**: 'First Name' and 'Last Name' and a 'Get Certificate' **submit button**. This button is only functional if the user completes both input fields, otherwise, they will 
be prompted to complete each field in order to generate the certificate. If they input fields are filled in correctly then the 'Get Certificate' button, when pressed, will take the user directly to the certificate page, which will open in a **blank tab** for user convenience. This certificate is populated with the **user input name** and the **score** they received.
- Also include in the results section at the bottom of the section, is a **2 button grid** that contains a **'Exit Game'** button and a **'Restart Game'** button. The 'Exit Game' button, if selected, will create a **pop up alert** asking the user if they wish to leave the game. The user has a choice to cancel the request by selecting the **cancel button** on the alert, or the choice 
to **confirm the request** by selecting the 'yes' button on the alert. Upon confirmation to leave the game, the user will be taken directly back to the homepage. The 'Restart Game' button, if selected, will automatically reset the game container, which will clear the previous score and begin the game again by displaying game container and the first question in the game.

### **_Certificate_**
- The certificate is a separate HTML file, created and designed to display as a **certificate** specifically for the game. It is populated using **Javascript local storage** to store the **user input values** from the form container in the results section, and also obtain the **user score** results.
The input values are stored using local storage and a separate Javascript file was created to retrieve these items and display them in the certificate HTML.
- The certificate is a **personalised addition** to the game, which will show the users name and their individual score each time they want to generate a certificate for their result.
The certificate is **optional** for users, and is only displayed if the user opts to complete the **form**, located in the results container and have submitted this by clicking the **'Get Certificate' button**.

## **_Features Left to Implement_**

- Additional Phonics sounds - other levels
- Additional educational learning games
- Abilty for users to select different level functions
- Add a drawing capability so users can practice writing the letter and words.
- Additional resources such as reading materials (access to e-books), songs, rhymes, stories etc.
- Additional activities such as fill in the blanks and audio games to guess the sound/word.
- Create a forum space where parents and teachers can discuss phonics and ask questions.
- Ability to set up a user account, to track and keep a record of progress made.


## **Technologies Used**
### **_Languages_**
- **HTML5:** This was used to create the structure for both the main page and the certificate that is generated at the end of the game.
- **CSS:** This was used to style all elements of the website
- **JavaScript:** This was used extensively to create the game section and functionality of the website

### **_Frameworks/Integrations_**
- **Bootstrap4:** Used for the grid layout for the website and modal dialog box.
- **Font Awesome:** Used to add icons to my footer and button on the website.
- **Google Fonts:** Used to select the font styles used on the website for the section headers and body.
- **JQuery:** Used for the drop down navigation and also for the modal created to display the game instructions.
- **SweetAlert2:** Used to create the alerts for 'correct' and 'incorrect' responses within the game and also as an alert when the user decides to leave the game,
asking them if they are sure before executing the exitGame function.

### **_Workspace_**
- **GitHub:** - (IDE) Integrated Development Environment
- **Gitpod:** - Cloud based hosting platform for managing my repositories, tracking changes and storing files.

### **_Other_**
- **Tinyjpeg:** This was used to compress the images used on the website.
- **Balsamiq Wireframes:** Used to create wireframes for this project

## **Testing**

**_Validation W3C HTML Markup Validator_**
- Ran code through the HTML validator and it was displaying an error with using an `<a>` tag with a button type, so I changed the HTML file to make the nav link an `<a>` tag and removed type = button.
The 'Let's Play' button was showing the same error, so I removed the `<a>` tag and left it as a button tag which resolved both issues.
- The other error that was showing up was that there was no source for the image tags. The src attributes for the image tags in the HTML document were being allocated from the Javascript file.
I did some research on this and found a solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30658663/bad-value-for-attribute-src-on-element-img-must-be-non-empty-for-dynamically) and 
added a '#' to the src in the HTML, which is then populated with the correct image source from the Javascript file.
- I ran my updated code back through the HTML validator and I found no errors.

**_W3C CSS Validator_**
- I ran my CSS code through the validator and it found no errors.

**_JSHint_**
- When I first ran my Javascript code through JS Hint, it showed a few errors with unused variables, so I removed any unnecessary variables that were still in my code and these errors were rectified.
The other error that was showing up was an undefined variable for the Swal variable used in my sweet alert messages. I tried to resolve this issue but the solutions I tried did not work. I am still working on this issue.

### **Tests Carried Out**


#### **User Story Tests**
**_As a teacher, I would like to have access to an interactive learning platform that would allow me to incorporate ICT and active learning within the classroom._**


This website provides an interactive phonics game that can be incorporated into classroom phonics lesson. It gives the user the ability to hear the sound as spoken in the English language, see and touch the images and read the associated written words.

**_As a teacher, there are not enough phonics resources freely available online that incorporate a multi-sensory approach to phonics._**


This website is easily accessible, currently free to access and uses audio, visual, interactive and written elements as part of the design.

**_As a teacher, I would like to show children that learning can be fun and enjoyable._**


The website is a designed as an educational game, where the users can learn phonics, while also having fun and immerse themselves in the interactive elements provided i.e clicking images, ability to hear audio at the click of a button  while also learning 
different sounds and words, getting familiar with using technology and developing important life skills.

**_As a teacher, I would like to see more interactive learning that incorporates aspects to fit individual learning needs._**


This objective has been met as the project includes a variety of elements that help the user to learn. By including a range of audio, visual, interactive and written elements, it allows for a variety of different learning styles that can aid users understand and develop their reading comprehension
and build on their letter and sound knowledge.

**_As a parent, my child like to play games after school on my tablet and I would like if there were more games that included learning aspects to enhance my child's development._**


Children today are introduced to technology at a very early stage, and spending time on tablets and playing games has become a daily part of their lives. However not all games provide an educational aspect to them and that's why this website is designed as an educational tool so that users 
can enjoy the online game aspect while also helping to develop their cognitive skills. The game acts as a regular game with a scoring element and questions but the content is educational and helps users to learn initial phonics sounds.

**_As a parent, in the middle of a pandemic, with all the schools closed, I would like to engage more with my child's learning experience but I do not have the correct knowledge of how these topics are meant to be taught._**


In this current climate with COVID-19, it is the perfect opportunity to develop a platform like this one. Many parents have found themselves in a situation where children need to be taught from home. Most parents are unaware of the correct way to teach these elements in a home setting.
This game provides parents with an educational tool that has been developed with the school curriculum knowledge, that will aid in their ability to continue the classroom learning at home, and encourage their children that learning is enjoyable. 

**_As a teacher, I would like to strengthen the consistency of school and home learning._**


This platform can be utilised anywhere, both in a classroom and home setting. With the hope to implement my future goals for this project such as adding a forum and additional activities, this will allow for a more cohesive structure and strengthen the
consistency of school and home education.

**_As a parent, I would like to access learning activities for my child that are accessible on multiple device types._**


This website is accessible on all devices, large and small. It is a responsive and versatile website that can be utilised while on the go through mobile or tablet devices or from desktop devices.

### **Navigation Bar**

**_Navigation links_**


_All navigation links should take the user to the correct targeted section._
- The navigation links all work as intended and operate correctly.

_The exit navigation link should call an alert to ask the user if they are sure they want to exit the game._
- This exit link works correctly and prompts the user to confirm or cancel their request to leave the game. This link
then takes the user directly to the homepage. This link is working with no issues.

**_Navigation bar responsiveness_**


_Check responsiveness of navigation bar using Chrome DevTools to check if it worked across all devices._
- The navigation bar is fully responsive, it shows three links to the right hand side: 'Instructions', 'Play' and 'Exit' on larger screens
and collapses into a hamburger menu on medium and smaller devices. This is working correctly and is responsive.

**_Navigation Logo link_**


_Check that navigation logo link directs user to homepage when clicked._
- The navigation logo link is functioning as expected  and when clicked, takes the user back to the homepage. This test was successful.

**_Navigation Links Hover Function: red colour_**

_Check that when mouse hovers over navigation links the text changes to red colour_
- When any of the navigation links on the navigation bar are hovered over with the mouse, they should change to a red colour.
All buttons function as expected and no issues were found.

**_Hamburger menu closing after link has been selected._**


_Check that hamburger toggle menu automatically closes after a link has been selected_
- The hamburger menu toggles to show the three links provided and closes on selection of the chosen link. I had an issue with this on a previous project and had found the solution for this on 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked),
which I used in this project to ensure the issue did not occur.

**_Instructions Link_**


_Check that the modal functions when instructions link is selected._
- When a user selects the 'Instructions' link, a modal pop up dialog box is displayed with instructions on how to play the game in a numbered format.
This modal has close button which works correctly and closes the modal box. This modal pops up at any time the instructions link is selected even while 
playing the game. This link works correctly and is visible and functional on all device sizes.

**_Instruction Modal: Scroll Functionality_**


_Check to make sure that user can scroll through content in modal dialog box._
- The scroll function on the modal works as intended and scrolls through the modal content as expected. This test was successful.

### **Homepage**

**_Homepage Hero Image Responsiveness_**


_Check that homepage background image is responsive and scales up and down depending on the device being used._
- I ran a test for this using DevTools on Google Chrome, to show how the site looks on different devices. I expanded and reduced the screen size to make sure the image fits the 
full width of the screen on all devices. The homepage hero image is fully responsive across all devices.

**_Callout_**


_Verify that callout is responsive and that text is displayed well on all devices._
- I ran a test using Google Chrome Dev Tools to ensure that the callout description and button were responsive and would scale up and down depending on the device being used.
The callout text is responsive and the text size changes slightly depending on the device being used. There were no issues found.

**_Let's Play: Call to action_**

_Test to see if this call to action button works and directs the user to the start of the game._
- The call to action button 'Let's Play' functions correctly and when clicked, opens up the game container displaying the first question of the game.

### **Game Section**

**_Responsiveness of images_**


_Test to check if images in the game are responsive on all devices_
- I ran the test for this using Google Chrome Dev Tools. The choices section of the game should show 2 columns on top of 2 columns with an image in each column in larger screens and tablet devices, and
on mobile devices, should align in 1 column block elements displayed one after the other. This test was successful and images are responsive.

**_Functionality : Images and Text correct from array in JS_**


_Test to make sure that the correct images and text are being populated for each of the questions in the game._
- To test this I completed the game, going through each question, and checked all choice images and text, and question images and text against my questions array
to make sure they were all displaying correctly. There were no issues found and all questions had the correct images and text that each question was assigned from the
questions array.

**_Audio_**


_Test to check if the audio letter sound plays when the 'Click for Letter Sound' button is pressed_
- To complete this test, I went through each individual question in the game and clicked the 'Click for Letter Sound' button on each
to check that the audio was playing and the correct letter sound was heard. This test was successful and the button functions as expected, 
no issues were found.

**_Alerting User on selection of either 'correct or 'incorrect' answers._**


_Test that the right alert is displayed if user selects a 'correct' or 'incorrect' answer choice_
- I verified this by playing the game and selecting a variety of right and wrong answers to check if the right response is received and the user 
gets the proper alert for their choice. This test passed and when the user selects the correct answer, an alert 'Correct' is displayed as designed.
If a user selects an incorrect answer then an alert 'Incorrect' is displayed as designed. No issues were found.

**_Score Generated from correct answers_**

_Check that score counter functions correctly_
- Again for this test, I played the game and selected a range of correct and incorrect answers. This test passed and the score counter generates the score 
as expected. The user receives 1 point for each right answer and 0 points for an incorrect answer.  


**_Submit Button: revealed_**


_Test to check if the submit button is revealed after final question_
- The submit button should be revealed after the user selects an answer to the final question. There should be a brief pause and then the submit button should be 
revealed at the end of the game container. This works as expected, the test was successful and there are no issues with the submit button at the end of the game.

**_Submit Button: Functionality_**


_Check that the 'Submit' button take the user to the targeted Section_
- Once all questions have been answered in the game, the submit button is revealed. When this is clicked it should take the user directly to the result's section.
The submit button functions exactly as expected, there are no issues with this button, it works correctly.

### **Results Section**
**_Results Section Form Validity - required fields_**


_Check that the user is alerted if input fields are not filled in._
- If you try to submit the form with only one of the fields complete, an error will occur
and prompt you to populate all the other required fields before the user can submit the form.
The form cannot be submitted without the required fields populated. And the 'Get Certificate' button will direct the user
to the certificate HTML page once valid input have been inserted into the input fields.

**_Storing Input Values in Local Storage_**


_Check that the input values are stored using local storage._
- I ran a test using Google Chrome Developer Tools where I filled in a first and last name to the input fields in the results container
and then selected application, then storage and then local storage to check if the input values were stored there. This test was successful and the input values
are stored in local storage as expected.

**_Background Image Cover_**


_Check that the background image height is full view height in all devices._
- I ran a test for this using Google Chrome Developer Tools and checked the result's container on all devices. It was covering the full view height in every device expect tablet devices when the
background container was styled as auto. I was able to solve this issue by including a media query for medium devices that set the background container to 100vh. Currently, there are no issues and 
the background container for the result's section is the full height of the screen on all devices.

**_Get Certificate Button Functionality_**

_Test to check if the 'Get Certificate' button functions correctly: It should direct the user to the certificate HTML page_
- The 'Get Certificate' button works as expected, once the input fields have been populated correctly and have been submitted via the click
of the 'Get Certificate' button, then the user will be directed to the certificate HTML page. There are no issues found.

**_Exit Game & Restart Game Buttons_**

_Test that both buttons take the user to the target destination within the website_
- The 'Exit Game' button functions as expected. Once clicked, an alert pops up to the user asking if they are sure they would like to leave the game.
The user can then chose to press the cancel button which will automatically close the alert on the current page the user is on. If the user selects the confirm button to
leave the game, this directs the user back to the homepage as it is supposed to. This button is working correctly.
- The 'Restart Game' button also functions as expected. Once clicked, it directs the user back to the beginning of the game, opens the game container and displays the first question and
clears the previous score back to zero. The user can then attempt the game again. This button works correctly.

### **Certificate**

**_Score generated_**


_Check to see if user's score is populated when they request a Certificate_
- I ran this test by completing the game, filling in the necessary input values on the result's form and submitting these
through the click of the 'Get Certificate' button. This was a test passed and the user's individual score is successfully populated to the certificate
when they select to generate a certificate.


**_Name Generated_**


_Check to see if user's name is populated when they complete the result's form and submit the values by clicking the 'Get Certificate button_
- I ran this test by completing the game, filling in the necessary input values on the result's form and submitting these
through the click of the 'Get Certificate' button. This was test passed and the user's name is successfully populated to the certificate
when they select to generate a certificate using local storage to store and retrieve these input values.


#### **Footer**

**_Responsiveness of footer_**


_Verify that the footer is responsive on all devices._
- I ran a test using Google Chrome Dev Tools to check that the footer was responsive and was scaling up and down depending on the device being used.
I can verify that the footer is fully responsive and the text size is altered to suit each device size.

### **General**
**_Check alt text appears for all images_**
- Hover over images to see if there is clear alt text visible.
All images were tested and alt text appears on images.

**_Conducted spell check on README file and text used in both HTML files._**
- All spelling errors were corrected.

**_Autoprefixer CSS_**
- Ran code through Autoprefixer and copied code back into css file.

**_Mobile Friendly Test_**
- Ran code on [Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) page and passed all tests. The site is mobile friendly.

**_Testing on physical devices_**
- I also asked friends and family members to test the website on many different devices including large screen laptops,
iPhone, android, android table and iPad and across a variety of browsers Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Firefox.

### **Issues Encountered**
**_Image Click to select an Answer_**
- I initially had set up the answers as radio buttons, but as this game is intended for children, I thought that having the ability to click the image would be more appealing and fun for them. So I attempted to add the image as a label for the radio button, so that when clicked, would also check the radio button element. It was not working as I had set up the input in HTML and
the label was being generated from the Javascript file. Therefore the label tag was not wrapping around the input tag in HTML. It was causing a bit of an issue, so I contacted tutuor support for advice. From that discussion I decided to set up the label tag in the HTML file, which included the input, image tag and a span tag with the image text in it, within the label tag. I set up four of these inside 
a div with a class of choice for the four options for each question. Then I was able to define the image src and alt tags from my Javascript file using the choices array to populate these choice containers. Using CSS I was able to hide the radio button element and this solved the first issue. Now when you click the image choice as an answer, the input tag is checked but this is hidden from browser.
- Another element that needed to be addressed was that I had set up a for each loop on the node list within the choice container, which did what it was supposed to do but in order to check the answer, however it was causing the game to skip every second question. I did some research and identified that every time I was looping through the node list the span item which is programmed to be hidden then 
revealed on answer selection was causing the game to skip every second element in the questions array. I was able to rectify the issue by changing the for loop to only iterate through all images and inputs within the answers container. This worked and the game no longer is skipping any question. The solution was found on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/API/Document/querySelectorAll).

**_Audio on Button Click (Game Section)_**
- While trying to set up the audio element for this project, I encountered an issue when testing the audio in the game. I included the audio files as part of my questions array of objects, however it would only play the first audio file no matter what question was being displayed. There was an issue, iterating through the array of object to locate each audio file. 
I decided to do some research on this as I had been informed that audio can be quite tricky to implement. So I came across a code snippet on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9419263/how-to-play-audio) and I created an audio element directly from Javascript using an Audio constructor and called the play method. I then set up an event listener on the 'Click for Letter Sound' button that would call the
set Audio function when clicked. Each audio sound now plays with its corresponding question when the button is pressed.

**_Certificate showing input values - separate js file_**
- I encountered an issue when trying to set up my certificate section of the game. I needed to store the input values from the form in the results container. I managed to set this up using local storage and wanted to retrieve the items and populate the input values in the certificate HTML. When I tried to call these from the script.js file it was not generating correctly to the certifcate, so I decided to set up an individual 
Javascript file for the certificate HTML called certificate.js. This solved the issue and now the cert is personalised with each users name and score when they complete the game and sign up if they wish for the optional certificate element.

**_Using 'for of' loop for questions array_**
- When I first started this project, I had set up a standard for loop to iterate through my questions array. This worked as intended, but during a discussion with my mentor, he suggested that I use a for of loop as an alternative as it was a more proficient way to loop through the array. I did attempt to implement the 'for of' loop, however, I struggled to get it to work. The problems I was encountering were that the answer images were either showing up duplicated in each 
choice container or only the last image would display for me. I did make several attempts to execute this change, but given my time frame with my project deadline, it was taken up too much valuable time I needed to complete my project, so I had to revert to the original for loop that I had started the project with. It would have been nice to implement something new and hopefully will get to use this method in another project going forward.

**_On click function still enabled after answer choice selected_**
- I encountered an accidental minor bug when testing my game. I had added an event listener to the nodelist of elements within the answers container. This was to allow the user to select an image as their selected answer to the question.
However, after the user had selected an answer, the event listener was still active on the remaining choices. This would give the user the ability to select an alternative answer, but was also causing the game to think the next question had been answered. 
This was an issue I needed to rectify, so I did some research and found a solution to this issue. I was able to stop the user from selecting a choice a second time on the same question. I did this using ```Javascript: choice.disabled = true``` within the checkAnswer function. This meant the user would be unable to click another image as an answer to the question.
In doing so, I also had to ensure that the choices would be enabled again, once the next question was displayed. I did this by including the ```Javascript: choice.disabled = false``` in the render question function. The solution was found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48082982/how-do-i-disable-all-radio-buttons-after-select).

### **Acknowledgements**
I received inspiration for this project from my sister, she is a primary school teacher based in Cork and had discussed with me the lack of available interactive resources freely available
online for parents and teachers. Orlagh was also extremely helpful throughout this project's development and provided me with essential information on the phonics curriculum, and she provided
the audio used in the game I developed.
I decided that this would be a good opportunity to test my skills and also try something new that I felt would challenge me and help me progress as a Software Developer. I have previously designed 
a business website and thought that a game would diversify my portfolio and show my ability to develop a different kind of project. 

I would like to thank my mentor Brian Macharia, for being supportive through this project, and also for his professional and very helpful advice through this process.

I would also like to thank Tim from Tutor Support, for his advice, help and guidance. It was my first interaction with tutor support, and I was very grateful for the exceptional support I received 
when I encountered an issue while developing this project.
